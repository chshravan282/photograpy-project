Project Description:

Smart Interior Design combines traditional interior design with modern technology to create intelligent, adaptable, and efficient spaces. It focuses on enhancing functionality, comfort, and aesthetics while integrating smart devices and sustainable practices into living or work environments.
Key features of Smart Interior Design include automation through Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as smart lighting, thermostats, and voice-controlled systems. These technologies allow spaces to adapt to users' needs and preferences, improving convenience and energy efficiency. Space optimization plays a crucial role, using tools like augmented reality (AR) and 3D modeling to design layouts that maximize utility and visual appeal.
Sustainability is another core aspect, with an emphasis on eco-friendly materials, energy-efficient appliances, and designs that reduce environmental impact. Customization is prioritized, tailoring spaces based on user preferences to create highly personalized environments that cater to individual lifestyles.

Core Azure Services: An Azure App Service Plan defines the infrastructure and pricing tier for hosting your apps in Azure. It determines the compute resources allocated for running your applications, such as CPU, memory, and storage. Multiple apps can share the same plan, optimizing resource usage. Plans are customizable and scale easily based on performance needs.

Azure App Service is a fully managed platform for building, deploying, and scaling web apps, RESTful APIs, and mobile backends. It supports multiple programming languages, including .NET, Java, Python, Node.js, and more. App Service integrates with DevOps tools and provides built-in features like high availability, auto-scaling, and security compliance.
